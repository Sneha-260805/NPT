"""
Merge two parallel directory trees of JSONL files.

• For every file that exists under BOTH roots with the same relative path:
      SOURCE_A/.../foo.jsonl   (unnormalised)
      SOURCE_B/.../foo.jsonl   (normalised)
  write
      DEST/.../foo.jsonl
  where each output line contains:
      {"unnormalised": <text from A>, "normalised": <text from B>}

• If one file has more lines than its twin, the shorter side is padded with "".
• Folder structure is preserved; paths are created automatically.
