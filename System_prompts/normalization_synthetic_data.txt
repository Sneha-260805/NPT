Tokenized unpunctuated
data I used for training
Raw punctuated
text data
You are tasked with generating synthetic data to train a normalization model in the Indian context. The data must be in
English, reflecting Indian English conventions, and contain unnormalized elements such as abbreviations, numerals,
dates, times, and category-specific terms. The output should be natural, coherent, and contextually relevant,
incorporating Indian names, places, institutions, cultural references, and everyday scenarios. The generated text will be
tailored to a specific category, subcategory, and document type, as specified below.
Input Parameters
-Category: {category}
(e.g., Medical, Legal, Numbers, Date & Time, Tech, Currency, Travel, Education, Finance, Identifiers, Units of
Measurements, Titles, Addresses)
- Subcategory: {subcategory}
(e.g., for Medical: Diseases, Treatments, Hospitals; for Legal: Court Cases, Laws, Contracts)
- Document Type: {document_type}
(e.g., Twitter thread, Article, Comment, Quora post, Reddit post, Blog post, News snippet)
- Target Length: {target_length}
- Tone: {tone}
(e.g., "formal", "informal", "conversational", "professional" )
Core Instructions
1. Objective:
Generate a {document_type} focused on the topic of {subcategory} within the {category} category. The text must serve
as unnormalized training data for a normalization model, meaning all elements (e.g., abbreviations, numbers, dates)
should remain in their raw, unstandardized forms.
2. Indian Context:
- Use Indian English (e.g., "prepone" instead of "bring forward", "lakh" instead of "100,000").
- Incorporate Indian proper nouns:
- Names (e.g., "Priya Sharma", "Rakesh Kumar", "Aisha Khan").
- Places (e.g., "Mumbai", "Delhi", "Kerala", "Guwahati").
- Institutions (e.g., "AIIMS", "IIT Bombay", "State Bank of India").
- Cultural references (e.g., "Diwali", "chai", "Bollywood", "saree").
- Reflect Indian societal norms, professions, and daily life (e.g., "auto-rickshaw driver", "government clerk", "monsoon
season").
3. Unnormalized Data:
- Include multiple instances of unnormalized elements specific to the {category} and {subcategory}.
- Do not convert data into standardized forms (e.g., keep "Dr." instead of "Doctor", "15/08/2024" instead of "15th
August 2024", "100" instead of "one hundred").
- Ensure variety in the types and formats of unnormalized data (e.g., mix abbreviations, numerals, and shorthand
notations).
- Naturally integrate additional unnormalized elements from other categories where relevant (e.g., a Medical text
might include dates or numbers alongside medical abbreviations).
4. Tone and Style:
Adapt the tone and style to the {document_type} and {tone} parameter:
- Article: Formal or semi-formal, detailed, 3-5 paragraphs, structured with an introduction, body, and conclusion.
- Comment: Brief, 1-2 sentences, conversational or opinionated, as if responding to a post or question.
- Quora post: Conversational, informative, 2-3 paragraphs, answering an implied question.
- Reddit post: Casual, engaging, 2-3 paragraphs, possibly with humor or personal anecdotes.
- Blog post: Personal or professional, 5-6 paragraphs, narrative-driven.
- News snippet: Objective, concise, 1-2 paragraphs, reporting a fact or event.
Prioritize {tone} while aligning with the document type.

5. Length:
- Aim for {target_length}:
- Article: 3-5 paragraphs (300-500 words).
- Comment: 1-2 sentences (20-50 words).
- Quora/Reddit post: 2-3 paragraphs (150-300 words).
- Blog post: 3-4 paragraphs (200-400 words).
- News snippet: 1-2 paragraphs (100-200 words).
- Adjust content density to include sufficient unnormalized data without overloading the text.
6. Coherence and Realism:
- Ensure the text reads naturally, as if written by a human in a real-world scenario.
- Avoid repetitive phrasing or forced inclusion of unnormalized elements; integrate them seamlessly into the
narrative.
- Make the content standalone, requiring no external context unless the document type implies a response (e.g.,
Comment).

Additional Guidelines
- Variety: Within the text, vary the format of unnormalized data (e.g., mix "15/08/2024" and "15th Aug 2024" for dates, or
"Rs. 500" and "₹500" for currency).
- Edge Cases: If the {subcategory} is uncommon or unclear, infer a plausible topic based on the {category} and
generate relevant unnormalized data (e.g., for an obscure Medical subcategory, default to diseases or treatments).
- Cultural Nuances: Reflect diversity in names (e.g., Hindu, Muslim, Sikh), regional references (e.g., "Kolkata" vs.
"Chennai"), and colloquialisms (e.g., "bhai", "ji").
- Avoid Overloading: Include 3-8 instances of unnormalized data, depending on length, to maintain readability and
realism.
Output Format
- Provide the generated text only, without additional commentary, headings, or formatting beyond what is natural for the
{document_type} (e.g., line breaks for paragraphs, bullet points for a list-style post if appropriate).
- Ensure the text is ready to be used as-is for training purposes.
